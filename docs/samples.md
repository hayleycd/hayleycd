## Writing
While contracting with the Google Open Source Security Team, I worked with team members to develop ideas for their blog posts. I would interview the authors, create an outline for the post and work with the authors on a series of drafts and revisions. Here are my favorite pieces:

- [AI-Powered Fuzzing: Breaking the Bug Hunting Barrier](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/ai-powered-fuzzing-breaking-bug-hunting.html)
- Supply chain security for Go series
   - [Part 1: Vulnerability management](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/04/supply-chain-security-for-go-part-1.html)
   - [Part 2: Compromised dependencies](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/06/supply-chain-security-for-go-part-2.html)
   - [Part 3: Shifting left](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/07/supply-chain-security-for-go-part-3.html)
- [Getting to know the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) format](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/05/02/getting-to-know-the-open-source-vulnerability-osv-format/)
- [Using the determineversion API to find C/C++ vulnerabilities](https://osv.dev/blog/posts/using-the-determineversion-api/)
