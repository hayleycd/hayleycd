### Who?
I am a lifelong learner, creative problem solver, and an enthusiastic supporter of developer communities. Sometimes I write code, but I also love writing for technical audiences--conference talks, blog posts, documentation and more. Technical education has always been a part of my professional life, and I enjoy helping others reach their goals. 

### What?
My ideal job would include the following:
- Telling compelling technical stories
- Helping others acquire technical skills
- Working with a team that is excited about what they are building
- Prioritizing the user's experience and building something that is a delight to use
- Bringing a creative perspective to my work

### Where?
I am currently based in Seattle, Washington. I have worked remotely for more than a year (pre-covid), with a globally distributed team. I enjoy travel, both personally and (occassionally) professionally. 

### Why?
I like seeing people fall in love with coding. I enjoy sharing technical information in a memorable way. I think developer communities have the ability to shape the profession for years to come. 

### Hire me
I am currently looking for a role in the following areas:
1. Developer Education
2. Developer Advocacy
3. Technical Writing/Technical Content Development

### About me
I love hiking, reading mystery novels, and trying to keep up with my Labrador. I have run a couple of marathons (slowly) and love to be in nature. I fell down a mechanical keyboard rabbit hole.
